# --- APP CONFIG ---
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Use https://kodas.works in production
```

### 4. Local Webhooks Setup
To test payments and user creation locally:

**Stripe Webhooks:**
```bash
stripe login
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

**Clerk Webhooks:**
Use `ngrok` or similar to expose port 3000.
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```
Add the `https://....ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/clerk` URL to Clerk Dashboard.

### 5. Launch Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## 🚢 Production Deployment (Vercel)

### 1. Build Verification
Before deploying, ensure the app builds locally:
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Vercel Setup
1. Push code to GitHub.
2. Import project in Vercel.
3. **CRITICAL**: Add ALL environment variables from step 3 to Vercel.
4. Deploy.

### 3. Custom Domains & CSP
If you use a custom domain (e.g., `kodas.works` and `clerk.kodas.works`), you **MUST** update the Content Security Policy in `next.config.ts` to allow scripts from your new domain.

**Example `next.config.ts` update:**
```typescript
"script-src 'self' ... https://clerk.kodas.works https://*.kodas.works ...;"
```
*If you see "Content Security Policy" errors in the console, check this first.*

### 4. Webhook Production URLs
Update your webhook providers with the live URLs:
- **Clerk**: `https://kodas.works/api/webhooks/clerk`
  - Subscribe to: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`
- **Stripe**: `https://kodas.works/api/webhooks/stripe`
  - Subscribe to: `checkout.session.completed`, `account.updated`, `charge.refunded`

## 💰 Refund System

### Overview
Koda includes a built-in admin-controlled refund system that handles customer refunds with automatic Stripe transfer reversals. Admins can review, approve, or reject refund requests through a dedicated "Refunds" tab in the admin dashboard.

### How It Works

1. **Customer Request**: Customers contact support to request a refund
2. **Admin Review**: Admin creates and reviews refund in the dashboard (`/admin` → Refunds tab)
3. **Approval**: Admin clicks "Approve" to process the refund
4. **Automatic Processing**:
   - Full refund issued to customer via Stripe
   - Seller's 85% transfer automatically reversed
   - Platform loses the 15% fee (standard marketplace behavior)
   - Notifications sent to buyer and seller
5. **Webhook**: Stripe sends `charge.refunded` event to update purchase status

### Database Schema

Refund tracking is built into the `Purchase` model:
- `refundStatus`: 'none' | 'pending' | 'approved' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'rejected'
- `refundReason`: Admin note explaining the refund
- `refundedAt`: Timestamp when refund completed
- `stripeRefundId`: Stripe refund ID for reference

### Admin Actions

**Location**: `/admin` → Refunds tab

**Available Actions**:
- View all pending refund requests
- Approve refunds (processes immediately)
- Reject refunds (with reason)
- View refund history (completed, failed, rejected)

### Server Actions

All refund operations are in `app/actions/refunds.ts`:
- `getPendingRefunds()`: Fetch pending refunds for admin review
- `getAllRefunds(filters)`: Get refund history with status filtering
- `createRefundRequest()`: Mark purchase for refund review
- `processRefund()`: Issue refund and reverse transfer
- `rejectRefund()`: Reject refund with reason

### Stripe Configuration

**Required Webhook Event**:
Add `charge.refunded` to your Stripe webhook subscription:

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
2. Select your production endpoint (`https://kodas.works/api/webhooks/stripe`)
3. Click "Add events to listen to"
4. Select `charge.refunded`
5. Save changes

### Important Notes

> **⚠️ Platform Fee Loss**: When issuing a refund, you (the platform) will lose the 15% commission. This is standard Stripe marketplace behavior and cannot be avoided.

> **✅ Automatic Reversals**: Stripe automatically reverses the seller's 85% transfer when you create a refund. No manual intervention needed.

### Multi-Language Support

Refund UI is fully translated:
- English ✅
- French ✅
- Spanish (add to `messages/es.json`)
- German (add to `messages/de.json`)

## 🚀 Troubleshooting


### Clerk Login Blocked / Infinite Loading?
- **CSP Error**: Check browser console. If "Content Security Policy" violation, you need to update `next.config.ts` to allow your Clerk custom domain.
- **Middleware**: Ensure `middleware.ts` is not overriding headers incorrectly.

### Emails Not Sending?
- **Domain Verification**: Resend requires domain verification (SPF/DKIM) to send to anyone other than yourself.
- **Logs**: Check server logs. If `RESEND_API_KEY` is missing, emails will fail silently or throw validation errors.

### Real-time events not firing?
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER`. It must match your Pusher dashboard exactly.
